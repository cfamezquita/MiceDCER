# MiceDCER
An Efficient Mice Flow Routing Algorithm for Mice Flows in SDN-based Data Centers.

It aims to reduce the delay on mice flows by reducing the number of rules on switching tables. It is done by installing wildcard rules and assigning PMACs to the edge switches.

It is written for Ryu 4.23 in Python.
